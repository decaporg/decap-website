# Decap CMS Website & Docs

This repository builds decapcms.org. If you'd like to propose changes to the site or docs, you'll find the source files in here.

## Local development

The site is built with [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org/).

To run the site locally, you'll need to have [Node](https://nodejs.org) version 16 and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) installed on your computer.

To install dependencies and start the development server, run the following commands:

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

Then visit http://localhost:8000/ - Gatsby will automatically reload CSS or
refresh the page when stylesheets or content changes.
