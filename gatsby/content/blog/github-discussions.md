Netlify CMS used the Discourse subforum on https://answers.netlify.com/, which is not an option for Decap as we are not affiliated with Netlify anymore.

We decided to officiate this service as our forum, as it provides all the features that we need. It's also very handy to move from issues to discussions and vice versa.

[Discussion about it](https://github.com/decaporg/decap-cms/discussions/6720)

Use it to ask questions about your config, contributing, new feature ideas, and more. This is a public space, so be respectful and help people if you can.

Happy discussing!
