With this release we bring you better performance and a more up-to-date product. Contributor experience and release pipeline is also improved.

Major updates in Decap 3.1:

* Upgrade project to React 18
* Avoid unnecessary rerenders
* AWS Cognito Proxy for Github
* Migrate from moment to day.js
* Migrate from yarn to npm
* Migrate from lerna to nx
* Updated documentation

...plus many minor patches.

There are no breaking changes.

This changelog is a bit lacking because we are in the process of improving the release pipeline. With that we will also automate and improve the changelog.
