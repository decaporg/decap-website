Documentation was reorganized so that items in the Beta Features section were moved to their actual pace - into sections where these features are supposed to be.

The Beta Features reorganization is a large and very welcome contribution by [privatemaker](https://github.com/privatemaker). The progress was tracked in issue [\#7040](https://github.com/decaporg/decap-cms/issues/7040).

The setup guide was also improved and split into bite-sized pages, so that it's easier to follow and navigate. This was also done by [privatemaker](https://github.com/privatemaker) in issue [\#7051](https://github.com/decaporg/decap-cms/issues/7051).

In more technical news, the website is now a separate repository, which improves the focus of each project. It also solves the issues of overlapping CI tests, Issues, dependencies, and more.

We will continue our effort in improving the docs. If you would like to contribute or comment, please join us on [GitHub](https://github.com/decaporg/decap-website) or [Discord](https://decapcms.org/chat).
