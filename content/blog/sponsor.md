**If Decap brings value to your process, consider supporting the project financially via GitHub Sponsors or Open Collective.**

Decap is currently maintained by an independent team who believes in this project and want to see it grow. We are committed to keeping and improving Decap as a serious and reliable headless CMS for developers and content creators.

But we need your help. We are not backed by any of the large players, so community contributions are very important in ensuring our future. If you find value in Decap CMS and would like to contribute, there are two ways you can do so:

1. **[Sponsor us on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/decaporg)**
2. **[Donate on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/decap)**

Your sponsorship will directly contribute to the ongoing development of Decap CMS, including bug fixes, feature enhancements, and community support. All spending is transparent on Open Collective, and we are committed to using your contributions responsibly.

If you are unable to contribute financially, there are other ways you can help. You can contribute to the project by reporting bugs, requesting features, and discussing ideas on GitHub. You can also contribute by writing documentation, creating tutorials, and helping others in the community.

We are grateful for all the support that we already received, be it financially or otherwise. Together, we can continue to improve Decap CMS and empower developers to build amazing websites.
