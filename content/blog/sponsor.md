In order to continue developing and maintaining Decap CMS, we rely on the generous support of our community. If you find value in Decap CMS and would like to contribute, there are two ways you can sponsor us:

1. **GitHub Sponsors**: You can become a GitHub Sponsor by visiting our [GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/decap-cms). GitHub Sponsors allows you to make recurring monthly payments to support our work. As a sponsor, you will receive special benefits such as early access to new features and priority support.

2. **Open Collective**: If you prefer a one-time contribution or want to support us through your organization, you can do so via our [Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/decap-cms). Open Collective allows you to make one-time or recurring donations, and it provides transparency by showing how funds are used.

Your sponsorship will directly contribute to the ongoing development of Decap CMS, including bug fixes, feature enhancements, and community support. By sponsoring us, you are helping us make Decap CMS even better for everyone.

We are incredibly grateful for any support you can provide. Together, we can continue to improve Decap CMS and empower developers to build amazing websites.
