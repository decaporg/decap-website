Your site CMS is now fully configured and ready for login!

If you use backends Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, Azure, or Gitea, you can log in directly with your account from the respective service by clicking the *login with* button on the /admin page. Note that the user has to have push access to your content repository for this to work.

## With Netlify Identity

If you set your registration preference in Netlify to "Invite only," invite yourself (and anyone else you choose) as a site user. To do this, select the **Identity** tab from your site dashboard, and then select the **Invite users** button. Invited users receive an email invitation with a confirmation link. Clicking the link will take you to your site with a login prompt.

If you left your site registration open, or for return visits after confirming an email invitation, access your site's CMS at `yoursite.com/admin/`.
