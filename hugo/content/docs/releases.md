## Update the CMS Version

The way to update your CMS depends on how you installed Decap CMS.

### Package Manager

If you are using a package manager like Yarn or NPM, use their standard procedure to update. This is how both the Hugo and Gatsby starters are set up.

### CDN

If you are using the CMS through a CDN like Unpkg, then that depends on the version tag you are using. You can find the version tag in the `/admin/index.html` file of your site.

* (Recommended) If you use `^3.0.0`, the CMS does all updates except major versions automatically.

  * It upgrades to 3`.0.1`, 3`.1.0`, 3`.1.2`.
  * It does not upgrade to 4`.0.0` or higher.
  * It does not upgrade to beta versions.
* If you use `~3.0.0`, the CMS will do only patch updates automatically.

  * It upgrades 3`.0.1`, 3`.0.2`.
  * It does not upgrade to 3`.1.0` or higher.
  * It does not upgrade beta versions.
